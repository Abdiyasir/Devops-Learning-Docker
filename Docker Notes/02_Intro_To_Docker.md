# Introduction To Docker

## What is Docker
- Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containers.
- Simplifies building, deploying, and managing containerised applications.

## Docker File

- A simple text file that contains step-by-step instructions for Docker on how to build an image
- Docker reads your Dockerfile line by line and uses it to assemble a brand-new image

## Docker Images
- Templates used to create containers
- They act like a snapshot of your application at a specific moment in time.

## Docker Containers
- Running versions of Docker images
- Containers are what actually run your application in a lightweight, isolated environment
- They use the images as the template to build the app and run them
